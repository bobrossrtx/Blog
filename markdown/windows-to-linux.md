# Windows to Linux

## Hey there
Right, so... I decided to switch to Linux and here are the reasons why:
- Very accessible
- Convenience
- It's very explorable
- interesting

The main reason I decided to use linux though is because I decided to try and learn cyber security but It quickly became out of interest but linux hadn't. I decided to continue working with linux even though I'm litterally running it on Hyper-V virtual machine on windows but it gets the job done. I actively run it and use it for programming, the Linux distro's I use are [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) & [KDE neon](https://neon.kde.org/)

I believe the 50/50 switch from windows to linux has gone very well esspecially since there are so many more things I can now do where as I couldn't on windows.
