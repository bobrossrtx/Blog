## Hey, I'm Owen
I'm a web developer who is always looking for more ways to get things done. I have multiple hobbies including streaming, youtube, rythm games and of course, web development. I take interest in more than just web development though, but I want pursue web development as my future career choice. The different types of development that I enjoy looking into is: mobile development, software development and much more.

When it comes to streaming, I enjoy to do it but I struggle finding good times to enjoy it, meaning that there is never a good time for me to do it but if you would like to follow me on twitch, here is my [channel](https://www.twitch.tv/bobrossrtx).

When i record videos for [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7wBhgG0dTIVUhciCIa4oew), they have originally started with [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) (rythm game), but i will progressively move over to programming videos and more.

I am always actively developing wether it comes to software on my linux machine or creating a drafted website for me to just pass time but everything I make you will see on my [github profile](https://github.com/bobrossrtx/). If you would like to learn [Go](https://golang.org/) In the same shoes as me, you can check out my github [repository](https://github.com/bobrossrtx/learning-go) for it.
